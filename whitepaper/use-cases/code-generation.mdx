## Objective

DeFi Quant Agents are specialized AI agents designed to execute sophisticated yield farming, trading, and risk management strategies autonomously on the Solana blockchain.

---

## Agent Overview

DeFi Quant Agents leverage specialized LLM models trained on financial, trading, and blockchain datasets. Each agent operates autonomously, analyzing market conditions, executing strategies, and optimizing for maximum returns while managing risk exposure.

---

## How It Works

1. **Market Analysis**: Agent scans DeFi protocols for yield opportunities and arbitrage
2. **Strategy Execution**: Automatically deploys capital across optimal positions
3. **Risk Management**: Continuously monitors exposure and adjusts positions
4. **Performance Tracking**: Records ROI metrics visible in the marketplace

## Example: Yield Optimization Agent

```typescript path=null start=null
import { VEXARA } from '@vexara/sdk';

const vexara = new VEXARA({ apiKey: process.env.VEXARA_API_KEY });

// Deploy a DeFi Quant Agent
const agent = await vexara.agents.deploy({
  type: 'defi_quant',
  strategy: 'yield_optimization',
  capital: 1000, // SOL
  riskTolerance: 'moderate',
  targetAPY: 15
});

// Monitor agent performance
const performance = await agent.getMetrics();
console.log(performance);
// {
//   roi: 12.5,
//   activePools: 5,
//   totalYield: 125.5,
//   riskScore: 45
// }
```
